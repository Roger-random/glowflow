# Glow Flow

Glow Flow is an interactive light sculpture project that reacts to sound, light, and motion.
The light show is orchestrated by a [Pixelblaze](https://www.bhencke.com/pixelblaze) running code in the file
[Glow Flow](Glow%20Flow) in this repository, sensing its environment via the optional
[sensor expansion board](https://github.com/simap/pixelblaze_sensor_board).
Other Pixelblaze patterns in this repository were experiments and research files leading up to Glow Flow itself.
